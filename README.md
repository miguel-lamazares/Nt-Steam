<p align="center">The "Nice Try" That Actually Means "Didn't Even Try".</p>

<h3 align="center"> WTF is This Abomination?</h3>
<p align="center">
Congratulations! You've stumbled upon Nt-Steam, a monument to human ingenuity (or a profound lack thereof). This name doesn't stand for "Nice Try." Oh no, that would be far too optimistic. It stands for "Nem Tentou" ("Didn't Even Try" in Portuguese), which is precisely the feedback you should give anyone who decides to use this.
It's a "conversor" (yes, with an 's', we're fancy like that) for images into text art, intended for Steam comments or other digital walls where you desperately need to express yourself in blocky, low-resolution ASCII. It's the digital equivalent of bringing a potato to a photography contest.

<h3 align="center">How to Waste Your Precious Time</h3>
1. Summon the Spirits: Open your terminal in the sacred folder where this script resides.

2. Chant the Incantation: Type ruby Main.rb and press enter. Feel the power surge through your motherboard.

3.  The Sacred Ritual: Answer the program's profound questions:
  
  * Image Address: > Point it to a file. Any file. It'll try. (It might fail, but hey, nem tentou really hard).
  
  * What size do you wanna convert to? from 40x10 to 100x40 > Pick numbers. Any numbers. Size is an illusion here.
  
  * Do you wanna invert colors? (y/n) > It works in black and white. If your life is as dark as your terminal background, maybe hit 'y'.
  
  * Do you wanna some style? (y/n) > This is a list of "styles" for "fastly" use. It's the fastest way to make your image look slightly different yet equally terrible.

<h4 align="center">Special Shoutout to You, the User</h4>

<p align="center">If you liked this... first of all, you have a LOT of free time. Please consider using it for something more productive, like watching paint dry. However, if you insist on supporting this descent into madness, you can stare at the GitHub repo intensely or maybe, just maybe, fork it to create something even more pointless.</p>
